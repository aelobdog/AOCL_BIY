# AOCL

Build-It-Yourself AOCL Project provides a simple build system for building individual AOCL libraries and creating a unified binary for integration. The purpose of this project is to have a single point of entry for all AOCL libraries and make the integration seamless.

This Build-It-Yourself AOCL will provide a CMake system to build AOCL-BLAS, AOCL-Utils, AOCL-LAPACK, AOCL-SPARSE, AOCL-LIBM, AOCL-COMPRESSION, and AOCL-Cryptography libraries and finally create the AOCL unified library in the name of `libaocl.so`/`libaocl.a` in Linux and `aocl.lib`/`aocl.dll` in Windows. The user can choose which AOCL libraries need to be included in the build and binary creation via CMake configure options.

**NOTE:**
This library will have one or more individual AOCL libraries based on user configurations. This repository will help users configure which libraries are part of the AOCL unified library.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `aocl_blis_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-BLAS.
- `aocl_compression_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-COMPRESSION.
- `aocl_crypto_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-CRYPTO.
- `aocl_libflame_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-LAPACK.
- `aocl_libm_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-LIBM.
- `aocl_sparse_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-SPARSE.
- `aocl_utils_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-UTILS.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Main CMake script for the AOCL project.
- `CMakePresets.json`: CMake presets for different build configurations.
- `Readme.md`: This README file.
- `presets/`: Directory containing preset configurations for different platforms.

## Build and Install

### Dependencies

#### Windows

- CMake 3.26 or higher
- Visual Studio 16 2019 or Visual Studio 17 2022
- Git
- LLVM (for OpenMP and Clang Compiler tool-chain)
- OpenSSL (3.1.3 is the minimum supported version, and max is 3.3.0)

#### Linux

- CMake 3.26 or higher
- GCC or Clang
- Git
- OpenSSL (3.1.3 is the minimum supported version, and max is 3.3.0)

### Getting Started

Same commands can be used on both Linux and Windows. The only difference is the environment setup. The default compiler and generator used will be the platform defaults.

For specific compiler and generator, use the following command:

#### Ninja and Unix Makefiles Generators

```console
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang
```

**Note: Replace the compiler (clang) and generator (Unix Makefiles) with the required one.**

#### Visual Studio Generator

```console
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -TClangCl
```

#### Checkout the Latest Code

```console
git clone https://github.amd.com/AOCL/aocl.git
cd aocl
```

or

```console
git clone git@github.amd.com:AOCL/aocl.git
cd aocl
```

#### Configure

```console
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install_dir
```

#### Build

```console
cmake --build build --config release -j
```

#### Install

```console
cmake --install build --config release
```

This command creates:

1. The necessary header files in the `<Install Path>/include` folder.
2. Static and dynamic library files corresponding to the AOCL library. Link with these libraries based on the functionality required.

**Note:**
1. This command creates a `<Install Path>/lib/` directory for the binaries.
2. Rightly update the include path and library path in the project to link with the installed libraries, or use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to the installed library path (`PATH` environment variable in Windows).
