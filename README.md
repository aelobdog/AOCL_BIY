# AOCL

This repository provides a simple build system for building individual AOCL libraries and creating a single binary for integration. The purpose of this project is to optimize CPU libraries for AMD processors.

**NOTE:**
This library will have one or more individual AOCL libraries based on user configurations. This repository will help users configure which libraries are part of the AOCL unified library.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `aocl_blis_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-BLAS.
- `aocl_compression_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-COMPRESSION.
- `aocl_crypto_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-CRYPTO.
- `aocl_libflame_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-LAPACK.
- `aocl_libm_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-LIBM.
- `aocl_sparse_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-SPARSE.
- `aocl_utils_build.cmake`: CMake script for building AOCL-UTILS.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Main CMake script for the AOCL project.
- `CMakePresets.json`: CMake presets for different build configurations.
- `Readme.md`: This README file.
- `presets/`: Directory containing preset configurations for different platforms.

## Build and Install

### Dependencies

#### Note

For the CMake workflow presets to use, the required minimum version of CMake is 3.25.0.

#### Windows

- CMake 3.22 or higher
- Visual Studio 2019 or higher
- Git
- LLVM (for OpenMP and Clang Compiler tool-chain)
- OpenSSL

#### Linux

- CMake 3.22 or higher
- GCC or Clang
- Git
- OpenSSL

### Getting Started

Same commands can be used on both Linux and Windows. The only difference is the environment setup. The default compiler and generator used will be the platform defaults.

For specific compiler and generator, use the following command:

#### Ninja and Unix Makefiles Generators

```console
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang
```

**Note: Replace the compiler (clang) and generator (Unix Makefiles) with the required one.**

#### Visual Studio Generator

```console
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -TClangCl
```

#### Checkout the Latest Code

```console
git clone https://github.amd.com/AOCL/aocl.git
cd aocl
```

#### Configure

```console
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install_dir
```

#### Build

```console
cmake --build build --config release -j
```

#### Install

```console
cmake --install build --config release
```

This command creates:

1. The necessary header files in the `<Install Path>/include` folder.
2. Static and dynamic library files corresponding to the AOCL library. Link with these libraries based on the functionality required.

**Note:**
1. This command creates a `<Install Path>/lib/` directory for the binaries.
2. Rightly update the include path and library path in the project to link with the installed libraries, or use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to the installed library path (`PATH` environment variable in Windows).

## Integration with Other Projects

Following are the build systems to integrate a library/application with AOCL:

### CMake

In the CMake file, use the following:

```cmake
TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(target PRIVATE path/to/libaocl/include)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(target PRIVATE path/to/libaocl/binaries)
```

### Make

In the compiler flags of the Makefile, use the following:

```make
CFLAGS += -Ipath/to/libaocl/include
LDFLAGS += -Lpath/to/libaocl/binaries -laocl
```
